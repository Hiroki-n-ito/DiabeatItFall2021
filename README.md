## How to push changes
1. [Install git on your computer](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
   * on mac type `git --version` in the console and it will prompt you to either install git or it will return the git version
   * on win install from [git-scm](https://git-scm.com/download/win) with the appropriate [32-bit or 64-bit version](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/32-bit-and-64-bit-windows-frequently-asked-questions-c6ca9541-8dce-4d48-0415-94a3faa2e13d).
  
2. clone this repo by getting the download url via `code > HTTPS > url`
   * (add picture for reference later)
  
3. use either CLI (command line) or [GitHub desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
   > unless you are familiar with the CLI, I suggest you use GitHub Desktop as that comes with a GUI interface
   * (add gif for reference later)

4. sign into Git on your computer
   * (add reference)
  
5. use the link from step 2 to clone it
   * (add gif for CLI)
   * (add gif for GUI)
  
6. open the project in Unity
   * [add gif for opening project in Unity]

7. get collaborating!
   * make sure you edit only the files you know that nobody else is working on

8. pull changes
   * number one thing you can do to avoid merge conflicts is to remember to `pull` updates from the remote before working on your device
   * this ensures that the version you are working on is the latest version

9. push changes

## Troubleshooting merge conflicts
Besides just crying, you can also:
 * nuke all the changes you've made and restart your local github repo
  1. Accept that you just lost your updates
  2. Delete local repository/files
  3. Redownload the github repo from this site
  4. Make your edits again :P
 * manually handle the merge conflicts
  1. decide whether you want to keep local vs remote changes in your merge conflict
  2. ???
  3. profit 

## Make branches?
**idk if we wanna do this or if it's a good idea**

## Practice with Git
It's easiest to internalize this control flow when you actually try it out yourself. You can do this by following the steps above and adding your name to [members.md](./members.md)
